Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm works efficiently with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1). The two pointers (slow and fast) traverse the list at different speeds. If the linked list contains a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet. Otherwise, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.
